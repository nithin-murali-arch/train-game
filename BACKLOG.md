## Sprint 08/09/10 — Daily Economy, Dynamic Pricing, Route Scheduling, Profit Tracking ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Make the economy live. Daily ticks, dynamic prices, route automation, profit stats.

### Phase Reference
PRD-01: E05 Economy Expansion, E04 Route Automation

### Tasks Completed
- [x] `SimulationClock` — accelerated calendar (day/month/year), emits `day_passed`
- [x] `EconomyTickSystem` — daily production + demand consumption per city, clamped to `[0, max_stock]`
- [x] `MarketPricing` — dynamic sell price based on shortage ratio from `target_stock`
  - Formula: `base_price × clamp(1 + (target − current)/target × elasticity, 0.5, 2.0)`
- [x] `Transaction.sell_cargo_dynamic()` — quotes price BEFORE unload, returns result dict
- [x] `RouteSchedule` — runtime route instructions (origin, destination, cargo, loop, return_empty)
- [x] `RouteRunner` — state machine: IDLE → LOADING → MOVING → UNLOADING → RETURNING → repeat
  - Quotes price before unloading cargo into destination stock
  - Deducts maintenance after revenue
  - Retries on `day_passed` when origin stock is empty
  - Transitions to FAILED on no path or insufficient maintenance funds
- [x] `RouteProfitStats` — per-route `trips_completed`, `total_revenue`, `total_operating_cost`, `total_profit`, `last_trip_*`
- [x] 23/23 automated acceptance tests pass

### Key Design Decisions (vs Original Plan)
- **No `TrainManager` yet.** Route coordination is handled by `RouteRunner` per assigned train.
- **No `CityEconomy.gd` singleton.** Economy tick is a plain `Node` (`EconomyTickSystem`) wired to `SimulationClock.day_passed`.
- **Pricing formula changed** from `base × (1 + (demand−supply)/(demand+supply+1))` to shortage-ratio model using `CityCargoProfileData.target_stock` and `price_elasticity`. This gives designers explicit control over each cargo/city pair.
- **Maintenance timing:** Revenue added first, then maintenance deducted. If maintenance cannot be paid, route goes FAILED but delivered cargo and revenue remain valid.
- **Dynamic pricing timing:** Price is quoted BEFORE unloading. Delivery is paid based on pre-delivery demand; cargo enters stock AFTER sale.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Clock advances days autonomously
- [x] Cities produce and consume daily
- [x] Prices respond to stock levels (shortage = high, oversupply = low)
- [x] RouteRunner automates full load→move→unload→sell→return cycle
- [x] Per-route profit stats tracked
- [x] Empty origin retries on day tick
- [x] No path fails gracefully

## Sprint 11 — Route Toy Playable Scene + Minimal HUD ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Create the first proper playable prototype scene by integrating the completed route/economy systems into one user-facing Route Toy scene.

### Phase Reference
PRD-00: E04, E05, E06

### Tasks Completed
- [x] **RT-01: Route Toy playable scene**
  - AC: `scenes/game/route_toy_playable.tscn` opens without errors
  - AC: Composes `WorldMap`, `TrackGraph`, `TrackRenderer`, `TrainEntity`, `SimulationClock`, `EconomyTickSystem`, `RouteRunner`
  - AC: Pre-built Patna→Kolkata track visible
  - AC: Freight Engine spawned at Patna
  - AC: RouteRunner configured for coal loop

- [x] **RT-02: Minimal HUD**
  - AC: Shows treasury, date, speed controls (pause, 1×, 2×, 4×)
  - AC: Shows route status, cargo type, current price
  - AC: Shows Patna/Kolkata coal stock
  - AC: Shows trips completed, last trip revenue/cost/profit, total profit

- [x] **RT-03: Route control overlay**
  - AC: Start route button
  - AC: Pause/resume button
  - AC: Reset simulation button
  - AC: Advance one day button

- [x] **RT-04: Integration validation**
  - AC: Train completes at least 3 deliveries
  - AC: HUD values update correctly
  - AC: Reset returns all state to initial values
  - AC: All Sprint 01–10 regression tests still pass

### Files Added
- `scenes/game/route_toy_playable.tscn` — Main playable scene
- `scenes/game/route_toy_hud.tscn` — HUD CanvasLayer scene
- `src/game/route_toy_playable.gd` — Scene composition and public control API
- `src/game/route_toy_hud.gd` — HUD logic, signal wiring, polling updates

### Key Design Decisions
- **HUD as separate CanvasLayer scene:** Keeps UI and simulation decoupled. HUD polls state, sends user intent only.
- **RouteRunner signals (3):** `state_changed`, `trip_completed`, `route_failed` — emitted via centralized `_set_state()` helper.
- **No circular dependencies:** `RouteToyPlayable` references HUD via untyped `$HUD` with `has_method()` guard; HUD references `RouteToyPlayable` via untyped `Node` parameter.
- **Auto-start on load:** Route begins immediately on `_ready()`. Start button restarts after reset.
- **Reset fully reinitializes:** CityRuntimeState, TreasuryState, SimulationClock, RouteRunner. Train returns to Patna.

### Definition of Done
- [x] Player can launch scene and see the core loop running
- [x] Player can control pause/speed/reset
- [x] Player can read economy feedback through HUD
- [x] No save/load, AI, events, campaign, contracts, station upgrades

- `src/menus/PrototypeStartMenu.gd` — launch route_toy_playable.tscn
- `src/menus/MainMenu.gd` — LoadGameButton wiring

### Known Limitations
- Mid-segment train position not saved; restores to nearest graph node
- Single-slot save only (no save slot UI)
- No auto-save
- Continue from MainMenu uses deferred load after scene change

### Definition of Done
- [x] Manual save/load works
- [x] Loaded game matches saved state
- [x] Menu can launch Route Toy scene
- [x] No console errors during normal play
- [x] Sprint 01–11 regression tests still pass
